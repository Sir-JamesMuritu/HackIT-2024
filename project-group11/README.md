# Background:
Bedwetting is a common issue in nursing homes and child care units, leading to discomfort and potential health risks for individuals. To address this problem, we developed an Automated Liquid Detection System using moisture and humidity sensors. The system provides real-time monitoring and alerting for caregivers, ensuring timely response and enhanced patient care.

# Problem Statement:
Bedwetting incidents pose challenges in healthcare facilities and child care units, affecting the well-being and hygiene of individuals. Manual monitoring is time-consuming and may lead to delayed responses. The need for an automated solution that can promptly detect liquid and alert caregivers is crucial for maintaining a clean and comfortable environment.

# Objectives:

* Develop an Automated Liquid Detection System using moisture and humidity sensors.
* Implement a real-time monitoring system with three detection levels: Normal, Start (initial moisture detection), and Urinated.
* Design a model system using cost-effective components, making it applicable for nursing homes, child care units, and beds for bedwetters.
* Provide a scalable and adaptable solution that can be integrated into existing healthcare infrastructure.

# Methodology:

## Sensor Integration:

Utilize a moisture sensor to detect liquid presence and classify it into three levels.
Incorporate a DHT11 sensor to measure humidity levels in the environment.

## Microcontroller Setup:

Use an AVR board as the microcontroller to process data from the sensors.
Connect the moisture sensor and DHT11 sensor to the AVR board using jumper wires.

## LED Indicator System:

Implement an LED indicator system with four lights representing the detection levels: Dry (Normal), Start, Wet (Urinated), and Off (No detection).
Configure the LEDs to provide visual cues for caregivers.

## Data Processing and Decision Logic:

Develop decision logic to interpret sensor data and determine the liquid detection level.
Program the microcontroller to activate the corresponding LED based on the detected moisture and humidity levels.
## Alerting Mechanism:

Integrate an alerting mechanism, such as a sound alarm or remote notification, to notify caregivers when the Wet (Urinated) level is detected.

# Prototyping:

Build a functional prototype on a breadboard to validate the system's accuracy and responsiveness.
Results:
The Automated Liquid Detection System demonstrated successful implementation during testing. The LED indicator system accurately reflected the moisture and humidity levels, providing a real-time visual representation for caregivers. The alerting mechanism promptly notified caregivers in simulated bedwetting scenarios. The system's cost-effective components and simplicity make it an ideal model for integration into nursing homes, child care units, and beds for bedwetters, contributing to improved patient care and hygiene.

# Future Enhancements:

Explore wireless communication options for remote monitoring.
Incorporate machine learning algorithms for more intelligent liquid detection.
Conduct further testing and validation in real-world healthcare settings.

# Conclusion:
The Automated Liquid Detection System is a promising solution for addressing bedwetting challenges in healthcare facilities and child care units. With its cost-effectiveness and adaptability, it has the potential to enhance the quality of care and improve the living conditions of individuals facing bedwetting issues.
